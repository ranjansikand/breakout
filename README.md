# breakout
Adds features and functionality to an implementation of the classic Atari game "Breakout," also known as "Brick Breaker."

My update builds upon the repository from Colton Ogden, adding new features to the game. These features include power-ups like multi-ball, which spawns two new balls when activated; paddle size increases as rewards for certain point thresholds; and a new type of block, the locked block, which spawns a key when hit with a ball: the key turns the block back into a normal brick.

To run the code, download the files and drag onto the "LOVE2D" desktop icon.
